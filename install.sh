# amux installer — one command from a fresh checkout to a running dashboard.
#
#   ./install.sh
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. checks prerequisites (rust toolchain, tmux; herdr is optional) —
#      prompts before installing anything, never silently
#   2. compile Rust binaries from a pinned commit into private verified artifacts
#   3. installs the server, Rust CLI and validated Bash CLI into ~/.local/bin
#   4. writes + loads the launchd agents (macOS): com.amux.server-rs on
#      port 8824, and com.amux.server-rs-builder (auto-rebuild on new
#      commits). On other platforms it installs the binaries and prints an
#      honest "run it like this" instead of pretending to manage a service.
#   5. creates ~/.amux (the server mints its DB, TLS material and auth token
#      there on first boot), waits for /health, prints the dashboard URL.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: re-running rebuilds and upgrades the binaries + agents in
# place. It NEVER writes into existing ~/.amux data (DB, sessions, tokens).
# It also merges amux's five Claude lifecycle hooks into ~/.claude/settings.json,
# preserving unrelated settings and hooks, so status reporting is actually
# connected rather than merely copied to disk.
#
# Overridable (used by the e2e self-test to install against a throwaway
# prefix without touching the live service — and handy for parallel installs):
#   AMUX_HOME           data dir                  (default: ~/.amux)
#   AMUX_INSTALL_BIN    binary dir                (default: ~/.local/bin)
#   AMUX_RS_PORT        https port                (default: 8824)
#   AMUX_LAUNCHD_LABEL  launchd label             (default: com.amux.server-rs)
#   AMUX_LAUNCHD_DIR    plist dir                 (default: ~/Library/LaunchAgents)
#   AMUX_NO_BUILDER=1   skip the auto-rebuild agent
#   AMUX_ALLOW_NO_TMUX=1  install anyway without tmux (dashboard-only)

# not show it, and cargo silent because writing there is its default and
